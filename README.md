# Introduction
A collection of cheatsheets of 
- a **data-mining** researcher who
  - write code with **Python**
  - in **neovim**
  - and enjoys **DevOps** tricks


# Runnable cheatsheets!
To make the most of cheatsheets, I try to make them RUNNALBLE!


Currently, only following cheatsheets are runnable
- TODO



# Catalog principle
The cheatsheests are categoried by scenarios.
- Because cheatsheets are often seeked when we are focusing on a specific scenario, putting them together will improve the *rate of hit cheatsheets*
